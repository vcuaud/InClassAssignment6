Added a second question and adjusted my original question of "Do movies with higher movie ratings generate more revenue than those with lower movie ratings?" as the answer to that question was too short, there seemed to be almost no correlation. I added a second question to see if the average film watcher enjoyed the same movies as movie critics, which I like way more but didn't want to delete my original work and question. I know you wanted a python notebook as a submission, but I added an HTML file as well because the scatter plots and histogram wasn't showing up and it might make your life easier if you could just open an HTML file.
